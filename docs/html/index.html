>	The <B

	developed by Red Hat to configure which SysV services in
	<TT

> are started at boot time (for
	runlevels 3, 4, and 5) and which <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

	description of that service as well as the status of the service. If the

	shows whether or not the service is currently running. If the service is
